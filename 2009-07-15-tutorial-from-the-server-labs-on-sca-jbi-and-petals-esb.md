Jacobo Matute from <a href="http://www.theserverlabs.com/">TheServerLabs</a> wrote a very good tutorial on its blog about developping a SCA based application using JBI and especially using PEtALS SCA features. You can find the article <a href="http://www.theserverlabs.com/blog/2009/07/07/developing-apps-with-sca-and-jbi/">here</a>.
