<blockquote>This video describes the current trends in the Future Internet of services and the Web of Data. The project SOA4All considers resources to be services usable via the Service Web. In order to address the current limitations of service computing at Web scale and to lower the entry barrier for the average Web service workers, SOA4all combines Web principles, Web 2.0 technology, context
management and semantics into a novel service delivery platform. The applicability of such a platform is manifold, and industrial partners such as SAP, BT and TIE have already demonstrated the benefits of SOA4All technology in the Public Sector, Telecommunications and eCommerce.</blockquote>
