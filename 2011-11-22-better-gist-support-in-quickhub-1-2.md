Gists are cool. So I updated the way Gists can be created in <a href="http://quickhubapp.com" target="_blank">Quickhub</a> 1.2 (submitted last week, should be validated by Apple this week...). The interface is cleaner and there is also drag and drop available so you can now drag a Finder file and drop it into the Quickhub gist creation window.

(No this is not the vodafone/SFR icon, it is the Quickhub one... Must really find a designer, last time it looked like a FB icon).
