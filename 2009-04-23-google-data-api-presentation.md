A quick entry on a really good presentation of the Google Data API, simple and interesting...

<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/google-data-api-gdata" target="_blank">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/google-data-api-gdata</a>
<blockquote>Frank Mantek discusses the Google Data API (GData) including decisions to use REST rather than SOAP technology, how the API is used, numerous examples of how GData has been used by clients, and future plans for evolving the API. A discussion of how GData facilitates Cloud Computing concludes the presentation.</blockquote>
