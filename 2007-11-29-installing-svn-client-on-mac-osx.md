   I am happy to see that Fink (http://finkproject.org/) is no more needed to easily install a Subversion client on Mac OSX. A client has been packaged by this guy Martin Ott (http://homepage.mac.com/martinott/).     Installation done by clicking on the package...          I am also happy to see that there is a Subversion GUI client for OSX. Working with terminal is cool but sometimes clicking on the mouse is not so bad...     You can found this client on 'La chose interactive' website (http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/fr/communaute/subversion/).       Configuration seems very intuitive... Going to test it for PEtALS project...
