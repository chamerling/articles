<a href="http://dragon.ow2.org">OW2-Dragon</a>, the Open Source SOA Governance Platform has been released last week in its 1.0-alpha version.
This version comes with a snapshot version of the <a href="http://petals.ow2.org">OW2-PEtALS</a> Entreprise Service Bus which embeds the Dragon Connector (PEtALS v3.0 to be released by the end of this year with lot of new stuff). This connector allows Dragon to import services hosted on PEtALS runtime and so to govern your SOA based application.

You can get the Dragon webapp <a href="http://forge.ow2.org/project/download.php?group_id=335&amp;file_id=13683">here</a> and the PEtALS Standalone Bus <a href="http://forge.ow2.org/project/download.php?group_id=335&amp;file_id=13785">here</a>.
