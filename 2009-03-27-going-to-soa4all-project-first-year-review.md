Next week at the SOA4All project first year review (Brussels NESSI office), I will show a prototype of the SOA4All Distributed Service Bus based on PEtALS ESB and on a P2P based library.
Like in every middleware demo, it is always difficult to show something 'sexy' since exchanging XML messages is not... This time I have a web portal based on GWT which is connected to the Bus which is more funky. The main point is how message are exchanged between PEtALS nodes with P2P and semantic techniques. I think this feature will be available in PEtALS before the end of the project (year 2011), so stay tuned.
