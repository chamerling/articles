While trying to find one free hour to give some feedback on OW2Con 2012, here are my slides from two talks I gave last week in Paris.

First talk was about what's new in the last version of Petals Enterprise Service Bus? The session also covered what is Petals ESB, what it provides and where it goes.

One other talk was about what we are currently developing in the Play research project. The difficulty was to give a quick view of this HUGE event-driven platform. More details are coming soon on <a href="http://play.ow2.org" target="_blank">http://play.ow2.org</a> (yes, Play platform is now an OW2 project).

I also participated to a talk called 'Dev 2.0 at OW2' with <a href="https://twitter.com/sauthieg" target="_blank">@sauthieg</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/clementplop" target="_blank">@clementplop</a>Â in which we introduced the new ways to develop using the OW2 tools and all this so-called social stuff every software forge now provides.

Coming back soon with feedback on several other talks, and some other OW2-related news.
