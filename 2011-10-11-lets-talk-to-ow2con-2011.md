This year again, I submitted a talk proposal to the <a href="http://www.ow2.org/view/OW2Con-2011/">OW2 annual conference</a> and it has just been approved by the OW2 management office.

While last year I spoke about some <a title="Mon talk OW2Con 2010 en vidéo" href="http://chamerling.org/2010/11/30/mon-talk-ow2con-2010-en-video/">conceptual things around the Distributed Service Bus and the Cloud</a>, this year I will go one step further with some live demonstrations not only dealing with service bus stuff, but also with some BPM tools and the Cloud stack we actively develop in the research team at <a href="http://petalslink.com">PetalsLink</a>. Here is my talk proposal:
<blockquote>All the services are moving to the Cloud, so are business processes. In this talk, we will show how to create collaborative business processes using an open source SaaS BPMN Editor. But designing business processes is not enough, why not running them in the Cloud? We will see that we can rely on a completely Cloud-aware SOA software infrastructure combining several open sources solutions such as a Service Bus and IaaS framework. The resulting ‘Cloud Service Bus’ allows the integration of in-house services in order to benefit from Cloud-based features such as elasticity, load balancing, service clustering and migration. This Cloud Service Bus will serve as the runtime basis of the business processes producing a Petals Cloud Stack solution. All in the Cloud, all open source!</blockquote>
I really hope to have time to work on some cool things to add more foggy-cloudy stuff and have things running on a real cloud infrastructure. I have many ideas in my mind these days and it is really really really cool.

Oh and I will also talk a bit about what we are currently building in the <a href="http://www.play-project.eu/">Play FP7 project</a>. We have to show things in two weeks at the European Commission and these things are really interesting to share with OW2 attendees and staff.

BTW, I think that there is some free beer social event this year at OW2Con, see you there of course!
