title: Summatweets - 'Read it later' with @node

Summatweets is a tiny @nodejs runtime which uses the Twitter streaming API to track personal favorited tweets and send a summary at specified time using cron jobs. It is useful (at least to me) when you do not have time to read all the tweet links and want to get them by email for later read.
