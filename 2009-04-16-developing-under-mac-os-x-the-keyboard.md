Mac OS X is cool but where are my special characters I need while developing??? Here are some keys combinations which are (quite) useful :
<ul>
	<li>| is under OPTION+SHIFT+L</li>
	<li>{ is under OPTION+( and } is under OPTION+)</li>
	<li>[ is under OPTION+( and ] is under OPTION+)</li>
	<li>\ is under OPTION+SHIFT+/</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:left;">Should be easier now...</div>
